     * Sequence of steps to follow:
     * 
     * 1. A GenerationalEvolutionEngine is the perfect engine to perform a genetic algorithm.
     * 2. A BitStringFactory must be used as a candidate factory.
     * 3. BitStringCrossover must be used as an evolutionary operator.
     * 4. The fitness evaluator must be performed by our class GamesGenerationFitnessEvaluator.
     * 5. The Selection process must be decided in the appropriate time.
     * 6. After all this process, the list of candidates must be (printed, examined, ???) after a performed step. 
     *         If it's necessary, a new one must be done.
